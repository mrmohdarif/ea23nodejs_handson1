It is designed to handle a large number of concurrent connections and can handle high traffic volumes without sacrificing performance.</h2><h3>Non-blocking I/O: Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which means that it can handle multiple requests simultaneously without blocking the execution of other requests. This makes it highly efficient for handling real-time applications and streaming data "
